# Introduction
This is about organizations becoming more data driven.
More specifically, it's about how a highly diverse and segmented workforce within an organization can make more and better decisions by combining their knowledge with access to data and technology.

## Why is this important?
Although the pursue and promises of this data-driven transformation are not new with organizations [^1] [^2], in my experience, these organizations often struggle to organize the data and technology components into meaningfull digital services that enable this transformation.

### Data Warehousing
Almost every organization has one or multiple datawarehouses of some sort.
Because of their longevity and prevalence in bringuing data to the workforce datawarehouses are a good starting point on what are it's shortcomings in a workforce that wants to do more with data then slice and dice reports.

### Data Lakes
At the same time the accumen from the Hadoop ecosystem showed cheap storage and compute could tackle the explosion of data and vendors jumping on this opportunity pushed for hoarding all the data using the moniker of Data Lake.

## Problem definition
In this article I argue for a centralized data and analytics platform open for decentralized contributions as an important engine for an organization data driven transformation and detail its services and customers.
