## Introduction
This is about organizations becoming more data driven.
More specifically, it's about how a highly diverse and segmented workforce within an organization can make more and better decisions by combining their knowledge with access to data and technology.

## Why is this important?
Although the pursue and promises of this data-driven transformation are not new with organizations [^1] [^2], in my experience, these organizations often struggle to organize the data and technology components into meaningful digital services that enable this transformation.

## Problem definition
In this article I argue for a centralized data and analytics platform open for decentralized contributions as an important engine for an organization data driven transformation and detail its services and customers.

This is especially true in bigger organizations

#### Data Warehousing and Business Intelligence
Almost every organization still has one or multiple data warehouses of some sort. Whenever you have one or more systems where data comes into existence and someone wants to perform aggregations on that data, you will find one.

The biggest consumers of this are people in front of a Business Intelligence (BI) tool connected to the Data Warehouse. They are typically looking back in time on different aspects of the organization (e.g. financial, orders, incidents, customer, etc).

Both the Data Warehouse and BI tool working together allow someone who understands nothing of the underlying complexity in the organization data and systems to be able to create, view and share, among other tings, the revenue of the organization grouped by its products.

Although their prevalence and longevity are a testament to its success they also have fundamental problems. The biggest one being how its cost scales with the amount of data. The nature 

#### Data Lake(s)
The acumen from the Hadoop ecosystem grew to a point  cheap compute and storage could tackle the explosion of data growth, from this the core idea of hoard all data and use it later on emerged.

Vendors quickly jumped to monetize this new trend under the moniker of Data Lake.

Data Swamp, Data graveyard

#### Modern Data Warehouse
Combination of last two patterns but still misses the point of delivering tech and delivering solutions
